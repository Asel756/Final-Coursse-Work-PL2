Project Requirement List
In this project, I plan to build a simple Online Shopping Cart System using Java. Below are the main things my project needs to include to meet the goals I described earlier. These features will help the system work well and give a good experience to the user.

Key Requirements:
Add items to the cart:
The user should be able to add products by typing in the product name and how many they want.

Show what’s in the cart:
The program should display a list of all the items currently added to the cart, with their names and quantities.

Update item quantity:
If the user wants to change the number of a certain product, they should be able to update it easily.

Remove a specific item:
The user should be able to remove any one item from the cart if they don’t want it anymore.

Clear the whole cart:
There should be an option to remove all items from the cart at once, like a “clear cart” button.

Count total items:
The system should show how many items in total are currently in the cart.

Search for an item:
The user should be able to check if a specific item is already in their cart.

Menu for actions:
I’ll make a simple text-based menu that lets users choose what they want to do (add, view, update, etc.).

Use Java classes and objects:
I’ll write the code using Object-Oriented Programming — like making a class for items and one for the shopping cart.

Use collections to store data:
I’ll use Java collections like ArrayList or HashMap to store and manage the cart items easily while the program is running.
