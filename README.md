Online Shopping Cart Management System

Student Name:

Description:
This project is a basic Online Shopping Cart Management System developed using the Java programming language. The main idea of this project is to create a simple system that allows users to manage the items they want to buy from an online store.

The system lets users add products to their cart, change the number of products, see everything thatâ€™s currently in their cart, and remove items they no longer want to purchase. It is a console-based application, which means everything happens in a text-based menu. The user types in what they want to do (for example: add an item), and the program does it.

The project is designed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), one of the most important concepts in Java. It uses classes and objects to keep everything organized and easy to work with. It also uses collections like ArrayList or HashMap to store the cart items in memory while the user is using the program.

This project shows how a real-world system like an online shopping cart works in a simple way. It also helps practice basic Java programming, especially how to create and manage objects, use loops, conditions, and work with user input.

Objectives:
Create a basic shopping cart system using Java.
Let users add, update, view, and remove items in the cart.
Use object-oriented programming with classes and objects.
Store items using Java collections like ArrayList or HashMap.
Build a simple menu in the console for user interaction.
Improve coding and problem-solving skills through practice.
Make the project easy to update with new features in the future.
